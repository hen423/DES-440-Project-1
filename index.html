        <p>NASA is on a journey to Mars, with a goal of sending humans to the RED Planet in the 2030s.
        That journey is already well under way.</br></br>The human exploration of Mars crosses three thresholds, wach with increasing challenges
      as humans move farther from Earth: Earth Reliant, the Proving Ground, and Earth Independent. </p>

        <h2>ABOARD THE ISS</h2>
        <p>Earth Reliant exploration is focused on research aboard the International Space Station.
          The orbiting microgravity laboratory serves as a world-class test bed for the technologies and communications systems needed for human missions to deep space.
          Astronauts are learning about what it takes to live and work in space for long periods of time, increasing our  understanding of how the body changes in space and how to protect astronaut health.</p>

        <p>In the Proving Ground, NASA will learn to conduct complex operations in a deep space environment that allows crews to return to Earth in a matter of days.
          Primarily operating in cislunar space, NASA will advance and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.</p>

        <h2>THE MARTIAN SURFACE</h2>
        <p>Earth Independent activities build on what we learn on ISS and in cislunar space to enable human missions to the Mars vicinity, including the Martian moons, and eventually the Martian surface.
          With humans on Mars, we will be able to advance science and technology in ways only dreamed of. Future Mars missions will represent a collaborative effort among NASA and its partners—a global achievement that marks a transition in humanity’s expansion as we go to Mars not just to visit, but to stay.</p>

        <h2>SUSTAINABILITY PLAN</h2>
        <p>At present NASA has embarked on an approach that will allow human crews to live and work productively on Mars for extended periods of time and gradually become independent of support from Earth.
          This requires not only an understanding of the Mars mission requirements but also constraints imposed by the Martian environment and the “known unknowns” that must be investigated and incorporated into an overall approach to pioneering on the surface of Mars.</p>
